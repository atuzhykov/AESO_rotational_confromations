# Neural Network for Stress-Strain Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a neural network model designed to predict stress-strain characteristics of materials based on experimental data. The model utilizes a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) architecture and incorporates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance predictions by integrating underlying physical principles.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for neural network compatibility.
- GRU neural network model for time series prediction.
- Custom loss function incorporating physical laws.
- TensorBoard integration for training visualization.
- GPU support for accelerated computation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (compatible with GPU support)
- Keras
- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (if using GPU)
- cuDNN (if using GPU)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Use the provided data preprocessing functions or classes to prepare your dataset for training.

2. **Model Configuration**: Initialize the GRU model with the desired parameters. Optionally, integrate physics-based constraints into the model's architecture or loss function.

3. **Training**: Train the model using the prepared dataset. Monitor training progress and performance metrics with TensorBoard.
    ```python
    # TensorBoard setup
    log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
    tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)
    # Model training
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=EPOCHS, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
    ```
4. **Evaluation and Prediction**: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset and use the model for stress-strain predictions.

5. **Visualization**: Use TensorBoard to visualize training metrics, model graphs, and more. Launch TensorBoard through the command line:
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
    ```

## Customization

- **Custom Loss Function**: The model supports the integration of custom loss functions, allowing the inclusion of physical laws or constraints that govern the stress-strain behavior. This approach enhances the model's predictive capability, ensuring consistency with physical reality.

- **Model Architecture**: Users can modify the neural network architecture to experiment with different configurations, layers, or neuron counts. Adjustments can be made to optimize performance based on the specific characteristics of the dataset or experimental setup.
